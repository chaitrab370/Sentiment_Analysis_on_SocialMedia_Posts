# Sentiment_Analysis_on_SocialMedia_Posts
Sentiment analysis of social media posts using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.

This project performs sentiment analysis on social media posts to classify user opinions as positive, negative, neutral,Irrevelant using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques.

## Objective
To analyze sentiments expressed in social media posts and identify public opinion trends that can help in understanding user attitudes and feedback.

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest  
- XGBoost  
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN - Keras)

## Features
- Data preprocessing (text cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization)  
- Sentiment classification using multiple ML and Deep Learning models  
- Visualization of sentiment patterns and trends  

## Visualizations
- Sentiment Distribution  
- Sentiment Distribution for Top 10 Entities  
- Tweet Length Distribution  
- Word Cloud of Tweets  
- Top 10 Most Common Words  
- Sentiment vs Tweet Length  

## Tools & Technologies
Python, Jupyter Notebook, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, NLTK, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud

## Dataset
Social media posts dataset (e.g., Twitter) labeled with sentiment categories â€” positive, negative, neutral, Irrelvant.

## How to Run
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file (e.g., `Sentiment_Analysis_on_SocialMedia_Posts.ipynb`)  
2. Run all cells sequentially  
3. The notebook will clean and preprocess the text data  
4. Train and evaluate all models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, CNN)  
5. View validation accuracies and sentiment visualizations

## Results
The Random Forest model achieved the highest validation accuracy of 0.744, followed by CNN (0.717).  
Visualizations provide insights into common words, sentiment trends, and tweet characteristics.
